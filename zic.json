Omitted counts default to extreme values.  The output files use UT offset 0 and abbreviation “-00” in place of the omitted timestamp data.  For  example,  “zic  -r @0”  omits  data  intended for negative timestamps (i.e., before the Epoch), and “zic -r @0/@2147483648”  outputs  data  intended only  for nonnegative timestamps that fit into 31-bit signed in‐ tegers.  On platforms with GNU date, “zic -r @$(date +%s)” omits data intended for past timestamps.  Although this  option  typi‐ cally  reduces the output file's size, the size can increase due to the need to represent the timestamp range boundaries, partic‐ ularly if hi causes a TZif file to contain explicit entries  for pre-hi  transitions rather than concisely representing them with an extended POSIX.1-2017 TZ string.
