As an option it has two purposes:  when a zipfile is specified with no other options, -v lists  archive  files  verbosely, adding  to  the  basic -l info the compression method, compressed size, compression ratio and 32-bit CRC.  In contrast to most of the competing utilities, unzip removes the 12 additional header bytes of encrypted entries from the compressed size numbers.   Therefore, compressed  size and compression ratio figures are independent of the entry's encryption status and show the correct compression per‐ formance.  (The complete size of the encrypted compressed data stream for zipfile entries is reported by the more verbose  zipinfo(1) reports, see the separate manual.)  When no zipfile is specified (that is, the complete command is simply ``unzip -v''), a diagnostic screen  is printed.  In addition to the normal header with release date and version, unzip lists the home Info-ZIP ftp site and where to find a list of other ftp and non-ftp sites; the target operating system for which it was compiled, as well as (possibly) the hard‐ ware on which it was compiled, the compiler and version used, and the compilation date; any special compilation  options  that  might affect  the  program's  operation (see also DECRYPTION below); and any options stored in environment variables that might do the same (see ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS below).  As a modifier it works in conjunction with other options (e.g., -t) to produce more verbose or  de‐ bugging output; this is not yet fully implemented but will be in future releases.",
